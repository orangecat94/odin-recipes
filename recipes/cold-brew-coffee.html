    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Cold-brewed coffee has become a coffeehouse hit, but those prices aren't. See how easy it is to save money by
        making cold brew coffee at home.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Coarse-ground beans</li>
        <li>Cold, filtered water</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Put freshly coarse-ground beans into any kind of container (glass is usually best). Use your favorite roast,
            but make sure it's ground very coarsely so it won't cloud the water.</li>
        <li>Gently pour in cold, filtered water at a ratio of 4-to-1 (for example, 4 cups water for 1 cup grounds).</li>
        <li>Stir gently to make sure all grounds are wet and cover container with plastic wrap.</li>
        <li>Let it sit at room temperature for 12 to 24 hours. Taste it occasionally and discard the grounds when the
            coffee hits your sweet spot.</li>
    </ol>
